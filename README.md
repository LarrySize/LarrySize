- 👋 Hi, I’m @LarrySize
- 👀 I’m interested in software engineering, but primarily pipelines and bioinformatics
- 🌱 I’m currently learning python, and have just completed my first project (a madlib) without a guide. I find learning by doing more beneficial than learning and watching. I'm currently working on a pipeline (more on that later!)
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ...anything simple that I can learn!
- 📫 How to reach me ...larrysizemore640@gmail.com
